### NETWORK:
- [x] Enabled virtual bridge across network interfaces so both can be used
      ![](Screenshot%202025-09-09%20at%202.03.32%20am.png)
      Need to do this otherwise only one interface will be auto-enabled on startup (the one connected as "slave" to the autostart-enabled `vmbr0` virtual network interface. think of this as a **virtual manager/`vNIC`** for all of your **physical interfaces** - so ***THIS*** should be set to **auto-start at boot**, ***NOT*** your the individual physical interfaces themselves if managed by the `vmbrX`!)
- [x] Make them VLAN aware
	- [ ] *In future - create one virtual interface for each physical to isolate them - one for LAN & one for management*

## Setup storage: `ZFS` 
Chose for:
- **Instant and Reversible Snapshots**
- **Native Data Compression** with `lz4`
- **Silent Error Detection and Correction**
- **Built-in Software RAID**
- Options for **Replication Between Nodes**, remote backups, & future HA
- **Optimised writing and block distribution**, resulting in better performance and less fragmentation

- [Even for single drives...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/wroqrb/proxmox_single_drive_should_i_use_zfs_or_go_with/)

***The trade-off: itâ€™s RAM-hungry (rule of thumb: 1 GB per 1 TB raw storage, plus headroom). At least `8GB`.*** 

Create within GUI: `Node > ZFS > Create: ZFS.` Select unused disk, ensure `Add Storage` is ticked, `ashift = 12`, and set your desired `RAID` level (for me, single disk for now, can migrate to a larger setup as add more drives).
