now, i'd like to preface this all by saying: **this is, by all measures, absolute madness.**

the biggest thing that i've learnt throughout this *entire* process (aside from how to speedrun de-bloating & installing windows and, to some extent, also installing linux systems) is that **the "perfect" system is one that you ACTUALLY USE."**

and I regret to say that, after [wiping my poor little lenovo thinkpad t480s 6+ times](https://juni-mp4.bearblog.dev/wk_05-reformatting/), **i have not yet found my perfect system**. even after this (comprehensive mess) of a blog post & process.

now, that's not to say that the actual **architecture** of what's described below won't suit me; i believe *that* at least will. 

# MY USE CASE:
*isolating windows for **esoteric gaming emulation & windows-specific apps (plus reverse-engineering & tinkering) exclusively**, whilst **using arch as my daily driver** should satisfy my suite of needs nicely in a small, compact yet capable form factor.*

***however...*** i ran into a number of workflow-breaking compatibility issues with my resulting [`omarchy`](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual) desktop environment setup post-install: repeated, random freezes when trying to configure basic system options within the custom-built (and undoubtedly beautiful) UI that i could find very little online about, and were difficult to troubleshoot due to the custom-nature of the build. and after all of this tinkering, i've decided that if they don't clear up in the coming days, i'll likely **just switch back to a simpler and more intuitive DE like KDE**, which i've wanted to try for a while and is both functional yet customisable without too many `.config` files to dig through.

because above all, i've learnt that **i want a system that *encourages* me to actually *use* linux, instead of wallowing within the `r/unixporn`-fuelled depths of "customisation" to find my "pertfect setup".**

because, in reality, the "perfct setup" is one that **inspire you to *use* the damn thing to do what you intended.** create things, write things, play things, build things - just actually **DO all the things**, instead of trying to *facilitate* the **doing of them.**

anyway. a long-winded intro, but i think it's nonetheless an important takeaway to share before diving into what will be a long and (hopefully not *too*) convoluted process. 

**godspeed, dear friends.**

`N.B`: *(note the above instability issues i am having is saying nothing against the brilliance of [`omarchy`](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual) as both a project and feat of engineering, but more about my propensity for further tinkering and troubleshooting with my system at this point in time now it's all partitioned and designed how i'd like it from a filesystem level*)

# General Overview of preparing Windows for dual-booting:
I began by following **[this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4XfaJY2TZo)** to prepare my custom `microwin` installation *(Windows stripped of all the usual bloat Microsoft pumps it with, created by the incredible [Chris Titus](https://winutil.christitus.com/userguide/microwin/))* for dual booting. The steps are outlined (roughly) below, as the video is still largely up-to-date as of writing:

- Install Windows with [`EFI` partition of 1GB or more with a `GPT` partitioning scheme](https://gist.github.com/n0ctu/375703184748c70c5caa4a108e96f6f7#2-disk-preparation) (ideally 4GB if want to do `btrfs` snapshots). 
	- I did this via windows install ISO + manual partitioning + using `Shift` + `f10` to open command prompt & manually making a 1GB `EFI` system partition, initialised with the `GPT` partition table, to be used as the `EFI` system partition. Should know if Windows detects this successfully after selecting the free space to create your windows system partition on, as Windows should **NOT** create **an additional `EFI` partition** and instead, pick up & use the (enlarged) one you created.
- After installing windows, **turn off fast boot & hibernation** with `/powercfg /H off` (see [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dual_boot_with_Windows#Disable_Fast_Startup_and_disable_hibernation)).
- Encrypt your windows boot drive with [veracrypt](https://veracrypt.io/en/Downloads.html), & ensure to save the recovery disk at the prompts.
- Check that you've disabled secure boot in your BIOS (may have to research how to do this for your specific device's manufacturer), & then boot into Arch ISO live install.

***Now - onto the "fun" part!***

# Installing Arch Linux on an encrypted `btrfs` filesystem with subvolumes, whilst booting from the same `ESP` as Windows.

*This guide has been primarily adapted from the following two **incredible** resources, and aims to achieve an up-to-date mixture of the end goal states described by each:*
- **[Linux (Dual Boot) Workstation Setup: Arch Linux, Windows 11, Encrypted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4XfaJY2TZo)** (YouTube)
- **[Multi-Boot: Arch Linux & Windows with GRUB, LUKS2, and Btrfs on UEFI](https://gist.github.com/n0ctu/375703184748c70c5caa4a108e96f6f7)** (Article)

# 1. - Pre-checks:

1. Check that you're in `UEFI` mode:

    ```bash
    # If this command prints 64 or 32 then you are in UEFI, if nothing, you're in MBR and should likely change this.
    cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size
    ```
2. Ensure your boot drive (for me, `nvmen1`) is formatted with `GPT` - should output `Disklabel type: GPT` after running `fdisk -l /dev/nvmen1` (or your corresponding boot drive).
3. Double-check that the `EFI System` partition listed IS your `ESP` - aka, your **EFI System Partition**. This is an *"OS-independent partition that acts as a storage place for UEFI bootloaders, applications & drivers to be launched by the UEFI firmware* (see: [the Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFI_system_partition)).
   
   You can check this by listing your disks & partitions with `fdisk -l` & then [mounting](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mount "Mount") the suspected `ESP` partition - for me, `mount /dev/nvmen1p1 /mnt`. Then, run `cd /mnt` & `ls` to check whether it contains a directory named `EFI` - which in turn, should contain your various bootloader entries (including Windows). If it does, **this is definitely the ESP and you can proceed.**

# 2. - Partitioning your disk for Arch + encrypted `btrfs`


## Partitioning overview:
![](/posts/29/attachments/Screenshot%202025-09-16%20at%2010.30.38%20pm.png)

Using `cgdisk` (I tried this out to name the partitions for convenience, but I much prefer the operation of `cfdisk`...)

![](/posts/29/attachments/Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%207.12.21%20pm.png)

Now, onto encryption. Thanks to the *Godsend* that is the ever-comprehensive [Arch Wiki Docs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#LUKS2), I discovered (after finishing this process & being locked out at boot) that **`GRUB` doesn't [natively](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/grub-improved-luks2-git/) support the default encryption algorithm used by `cryptsetup`** (`Argon2id` & its Password-Based Key Derivation Functions, or `PBKDFs`) - see [GRUB bug #59409](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?59409).

Thus, if we choose to use the more modern `LUKS2` (good practice over `LUKS1`) we must convert it to use `PBKDF2`, detailed below:

``` bash
# encrypt root partition using LUKS2
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p7 --type luks2 --verify-passphrase

# convert the hash and PBDKDF algorithms for this encrypted volume
cryptsetup luksConvertKey --hash sha256 --pbkdf pbkdf2 /dev/nvme0n1p7

# open root partition as "cryptroot"
cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p7 cryptroot

```

Now, we should be able to see inside `/dev/nvme0n1p7` - check it out with `lsblk -f`!

# 3. - Making the `btrfs` file system and subvolumes:

``` bash
# Make your (encrypted) partition a Btrfs filesystem
mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/mapper/cryptroot

# Mount temporarily
mount /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt

# Create subvolumes
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@root      # system root, '/' on the final system
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@home      # system home, ‘/home’ on the final system
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@snapshots # system snapshots, '/.snapshots’ on the final system

# get out of /mnt (otherwise can't umount)
cd /

# Unmount to remount subvolumes with options (see below)
umount /mnt
```

---
# 4. - Mounting `btrfs` subvolumes with optimised options (for `SSD`s):

``` bash

# Create mount directories
mkdir -p /mnt/{home,.snapshots}

# Mount persistent subvolumes
mount -t btrfs -o subvol=@root,compress=zstd,noatime,ssd,discard=async /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt
mount -t btrfs -o subvol=@home,compress=zstd,noatime,ssd,discard=async /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/home
mount -t btrfs -o subvol=@snapshots,compress=zstd,noatime,ssd,discard=async /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/.snapshots

```

## An overview of the options explained:

| Option          | Purpose                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `subvol=root`   | Mount the specific subvolume as root                                |
| `compress=zstd` | Compress files to save space, reduce writes, possibly improve speed |
| `noatime`       | Don’t update file access times → reduces unnecessary writes         |
| `ssd`           | Optimize Btrfs allocation for SSD characteristics                   |
| `discard=async` | Enable background TRIM to keep SSD healthy and fast                 |

# 5. - Creating a `SWAP` partition:

For simplicity, I'll be going with creating a dedicated [`SWAP` partition](/title/Swap#Swap_partition) as opposed to a [`SWAP` file](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Swap#Swap_partition), to `SWAP` file support on `btrfs` is potentially a [little dodgy with hibernation](https://www.jwillikers.com/btrfs-swapfile) (but am unsure on this):

``` bash
# Make the SWAP (take note of UUID for later)
mkswap /dev/nvme0n1p6

# Activate SWAP
swapon /dev/nvme0n1p6

# Check it's mounted as [SWAP]
lsblk

# Add following entry to /etc/fstab using something like vim, changing the below to your corresponding SWAP partition's UUID
UUID=879c97b6-0117-4550-a53d-1fa4c0197841 none swap defaults 0 0

# Confirm it's active & on
swapon --show
```

# 6. - Make your `ext4` `/boot` partition

I'll be making this as its **own partition** for simplicity (as opposed to it being **an encrypted subvolume**, as that will require additional steps to boot from as it will need to be [decrypted at startup](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Encrypted_/boot)). 

The `/boot` partition differs from the `ESP` as it primarily contains important **linux-specific system files** (kernel images, initial RAM disk, bootloader resources like for `GRUB`, etc.) - hence why separating it from the `ESP` is a good idea wherever possible, *especially* if the `ESP` is small.

``` bash
# Make the /boot partition as an ext4 filesystem, for GRUB
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p5

# Create the /boot directory and mount it:
mkdir -p /mnt/boot

mount /dev/nvme0n1p5 /mnt/boot
```

---
# 7. - Mount the existing `ESP` to a newly-created `/mnt/efi` directory

Make a new directory on your `linux` filesystem to mount the existing `ESP` - in my case, I'll use `/mnt/efi` (see [here for benefits](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFI_system_partition#Typical_mount_points) - however, this naming scheme/location only supported when using `GRUB` or `rEFInd`).

``` bash
# Make /efi directory
mkdir /mnt/efi

# Mount it on the existing (Windows-created) ESP
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/efi
```

Now check you've got all your filesystems mounted properly:
![](/posts/29/attachments/Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%208.06.39%20pm.png)
... and that each has a filesystem type and is similar to the following structure (from `nvmen1p5` down):
![](/posts/29/attachments/Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%208.06.48%20pm.png)

# 8. - Post-partitioning steps:

- **First, set the **mirrorlist** to download your packages from (this will persist on the actual system)** Generate optimal ones for your region [here](https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/) (recommend to use `https`), and then add/replace the ones in `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`.

- Now, to **`pacstrap` your system with "the basics"** (will install more later):
  `pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware intel-ucode btrfs-progs curl wget vim sudo GRUB efibootmgr os-prober networkmanager cryptsetup base-devel git less` (and any other desired base packages)
  
  *See the [arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide#Install_essential_packages) for what to swap in/out based on your system, but is primarily hardware-based packages like `intel-ucode`/`amd-ucode`, and bootloader-specific options like `GRUB` & `os-prober` etc. And if you use NVIDIA... see [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA).*

- Now to **generate the filesystem table with `genfstab`**, outlining which block devices hold what data, so your system knows how to access it all, with `genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab`
  
  Make sure to open up `/mnt/etc/fstab` to check for any errors with the `UUID`s listed, but it should be auto-generated:
  ![](/posts/29/attachments/Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%208.20.17%20pm.png)

- Now, time to `arch-chroot` & directly interact with your new system's environment! Once you're in, perform the following - referencing the corresponding sections of the [Arch installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide#Time) (as these steps are fairly standard fare):
	- Generate locales
	- Set root password
	- Create (sudo) user & set password, edit `sudoers` file if desired
	- Set hostname
	- ...etc.

- As we're encrypting the filesystem, we need to make a few small changes to `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` to change the hooks for the booting process, in order for our system to be able to [unlock our `LUKS`-encrypted `/root` partition](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#Configuring_mkinitcpio). **Note the ORDER of these highlighted entries - it's VERY important.** 
  
  Add `block encrypt filesystems btrfs resume`, in that order:
  ![](/posts/29/attachments/Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%208.36.48%20pm.png)
  
  Afterwards, recreate the `initramfs` image with `mkinitcpio -P`.

---
# 9. - Setup GRUB to unlock & boot your system(s)!

Almost there! Time to install some additional tools for setting up `GRUB`'s capabilities (note the use of `pacman` now we're **inside** the system itself):

`pacman -S dosfstools os-prober mtools memtest86+`

Then, install GRUB in `/efi` (if that's where your `/boot` is mounted, as I did earlier):

`grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB`


Now - **take CAREFUL note of the various** `UUID`s of your block device partitions - in particular, the:
- **Windows-created ESP** (for me, the `UUID` of `nvme0n1p1`)
- **Your `SWAP` partition** (for me, the `UUID` of `nvme0n1p6`)
- **Your ENCRYPTED `/root` partition** (for me, the `UUID` of `nvme0n1p7`). *Note - **NOT** the `UUID` of the **[device mapper](https://linuxvox.com/blog/dev-mapper-linux/)**`/dev/mapper/XXXXXXXX`, but of the **actual block device** `nvme0n1pX`.*

You can find these with something like `blkid | less -S`, and carefully filtering for the known mounted devices:

``` bash
# >> Windows-created ESP <<
/dev/nvme0n1p1: LABEL="EFI" UUID="26CC-B80A" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat" PARTLABEL="EFI system partition" PARTUUID="8932caff-45aa-4e22-bd46-e0c5e59a0493"

# >> SWAP partition <<
/dev/nvme0n1p6: UUID="879c97b6-0117-4550-a53d-1fa4c0197841" TYPE="swap" PARTLABEL="swap" PARTUUID="0221c16e-2488-4183-8a87-1480a4674642"

# Encrypted DEVICE containing your root partition
/dev/nvme0n1p7: UUID="633a5bdc-2ee2-4646-88b0-b117751807f1" TYPE="crypto_LUKS" PARTLABEL="root" PARTUUID="dcbc0b5c-29aa-4de6-8bcb-85a9e1e20fe9"

```

Then, edit the line `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""` in `/etc/default/grub` to include the following file, filling in the `UUIDs` of your **encrypted root partition** and `SWAP` (unsure if the latter is necessary) block devices:

``` bash
# e.g for me, my encrypted /root partition is on /dev/nvmen1p7, so replace it in <luks-device-uuid> its UUID after "cryptdevice=UUID=", and my SWAP's UUID after resume=UUID=<swap-uuid>:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cryptdevice=UUID=<luks-device-uuid>:cryptroot root=/dev/mapper/cryptroot resume=UUID=<swap-uuid>"

```

*E.g.:* 
![](/posts/29/attachments/Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%208.49.25%20pm.png)

Also within the same file, **uncomment** `GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false` so that `GRUB`can auto-detect Windows & add its bootloader to the menu. You can also add an entry for this manually if you prefer, as shown [here](https://gist.github.com/n0ctu/375703184748c70c5caa4a108e96f6f7#498-install-and-configure-grub).

![](/posts/29/attachments/Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%208.50.35%20pm.png)

Then, simply generate the new `GRUB` boot menu with `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`. Monitor the output for what entries it is able to detect, and troubleshoot accordingly if it misses either the windows or linux entries.

![](/posts/29/attachments/Screenshot%202025-09-15%20at%208.58.19%20pm.png)

If it does miss any, you can add entries manually as [described here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Windows_installed_in_UEFI/GPT_mode), by creating files like `/etc/grub.d/40_custom`. E.g., if `os-prober` doesn't detect your `Windows Boot Manager`, or you want to add any other boot entries. 

**Example:**

``` bash
#!/bin/sh
exec tail -n +3 $0

menuentry "VeraCrypt Bootloader (Windows)" --class windows --class os {
    insmod part_gpt
    insmod fat
    # replacing 26CC-B80A with your actual ESP's UUID
    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 26CC-B80A
    chainloader /EFI/VeraCrypt/DcsBoot.efi
}
```

Once done, you can `exit` the `chroot` environment, unmount everything with `umount -R /mnt` & `swapoff -a`, and then... pray, and `reboot`.

If all goes well, you should be presented with the `GRUB` menu upon rebooting, and be able to select & boot into Windows & Arch linux, both prompting you to enter the passwords for the encrypted partitions before doing so! :3

# 10. [OPTIONAL] - Installing the [omarchy](https://learn.omacom.io/2/the-omarchy-manual) desktop environment

*[note that, as per my preamble at the beginning of the article, i may/may not be moving away from using this for the forseeable future]*

**In stark contrast to the rest of this guide**... installing `omarchy` is as simple as logging into your new Arch system, ensuring you have a network connection & running the following command:

`curl -fsSL https://omarchy.org/install | bash`

And then follow the prompts.

***Yep. That's it.***

And then, reboot, and... voila!

# Troubleshooting Tips *(because every good Arch install comes with it pre-loaded)*

If you run into any errors, Google is your best friend - but if you need to get back into your `Arch` install to modify the boot settings, run the below set of commands to remount your filesystem & `btrfs` (sub)volumes in order to safely do so. 

``` bash
# open & enter encrypted root partition
cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p7 cryptroot

# re-mount sub-volumes
mount -o subvol=@root /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt
mount -o subvol=@home /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/home
mount -o subvol=@snapshots /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/.snapshots

# re-mount boot & ESP partitions
mount /dev/nvme0n1p5 /mnt/boot
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/efi

# now you can enter the filesystem & edit your arch system files normally
arch-chroot /mnt

```

*I had to do this once as I initially put the `UUID` of `/dev/mapper/cryptroot` instead of `/dev/nvmen1p7` for my `root` partition to be unlocked & loaded at boot, hence my extreme emphasis on grabbing the right one above!*
