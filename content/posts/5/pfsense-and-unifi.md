Hi all! After a long and troublesome battle against the gods of networking and the intricacies of pfSense, I have
finally developed a process (that I understand, at least) for **initialising an `ETHX` port to pass VLAN traffic that is
tagged externally by a switching device** (in my case, a [*USW-PRO 48PoE UniFi managed
switch*](https://ubiquitistore.com.au/product/ubiquiti-unifi-48-port-managed-gigabit-layer2-and-layer3-switch-with-auto-sensing-802-3at-poe-and-802-3bt-poe-touch-display-660w-gen2-usw-pro-48-poe-au/)).

In the hope that this can be of use to others out there, I have written up my process for doing so below. But first,
here is a contextual network diagram for my setup:

<img src="/posts/5/netdia.png" width="" height="">


## - Steps taken:

1. Plug in an ethernet cable to an unused port on the pfSense box. In my case, this is **ETH3** (gray cable).
    <img src="/posts/5/eth3.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
    <br></br>

2. Login to the pfSense router GUI via the browser (default address is `192.168.0.1`, or `XXX.XXX.XXX.1` depending on how you've setup the management LAN it's on), and navigate to **Interfaces / Switches / Ports**.

    <img src="/posts/5/image.png" width="50%" height="50%">
    <br></br>

3. Check the targeted port ETH3 is **ACTIVE**, and then edit the **Port VID** to be **whatever VLAN tag you want to be applied to passing UNTAGGED traffic by DEFAULT.** For ex, `Port VID = 80` will mean any **untagged passing traffic** through ETH3 gets a VLAN tag of `80`.

    ![](/posts/5/image0.png)
    <br></br>

4. **Interfaces / Switches / VLANs**: Click `+ Add Tag`

    Add whatever VLAN tag you wish to target (in this case `80`), give it a description, and add the **Members**, AKA <mark style="color:rgb(199, 255, 252)"><span style="color: rgb(255, 209, 4); font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">the numbered ETH ports on the pfSense (ETH1 to ETH10) that will allow this VLAN through.</span></mark>

    ![](/posts/5/image-2.png)

    ![](/posts/5/image-3.png)

    **I have added ETH3 as a member**, and told pfSense to expect the traffic passing through to be **untagged**.
    This means that any **untagged traffic through ETH3 will be assigned a VLAN tag of 80** (ETH3‚Äôs Port VID, as specified
    in Step 1).
    Don't forget to click `Save`.

    <mark class="simple-highlight">NOTE:</mark>
    ***ALWAYS ADD 9 & 10 as tagged members by default*** *(**WHY** this must be done is beyond the scope of this tutorial
    but perhaps write an article about it soon as it explains a lot about how the internals of pfSense actually functions.
    alternatively, for the curious, read the docs
    [here](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/solutions/xg-7100-1u/switch-overview.html))*

    ***Key:***

    `9t` = Port 9, expecting & passing **VLAN-tagged** traffic ONLY.

    `3` = Port 3, expecting & passing **untagged** traffic ONLY.
    <br></br>


5. **Interfaces / Assignments / VLANs.** Click `+ Add`: 
    
    ![](/posts/5/image5.png)

    For **Parent Interface**, select whatever interface corresponds to `ETH3`, or a `lagg` group it‚Äôs part of (if any have
    been created by default/you). In my case, I have `lagg0` bundling connections from ETH1-8 for load balancing purposes,
    so it's my parent interface.

    Assign it the desired VLAN tag (`80` in my case) and give it a description before pressing `Save`.

    <br></br>

6. **Interfaces / Interface Assignments**: 

    You should now be able to select the VLAN you created from the dropdown next to **Available Network Ports**, and click `+ Add` to assign it to an Interface.

    ![](/posts/5/image-7.png)

    You can then set up the interface by clicking on the blue link, assigning an ip type, range, and other cool stuff. I set
    this interface (& thus `VLAN 80`) to have an ip range of `192.168.80.X/24`. This can be any ip address as long as it
    doesn‚Äôt encroach on any other existing interface ranges, but I recommend sticking within the conventional ranges for
    unrouted private networking to avoid confusing things (192.168.0.0, 172.16.0.0 and 10.0.0.0).

    Then tick `Enable Iterface` and press `Save`.

    ![](/posts/5/image-8.png)

    Don't forget to `Apply Changes` before navigating away!

    ![](/posts/5/image-9.png)
    <br></br>


7. Navigate to **Services / DHCP Server** and select the interface name you just created (`ADLSWITCH` for me).

    Here, we can set the pool of IP addresses this interface will assign to connected devices on `VLAN 80`, as well as any
    other custom settings. The only one I set was **Domain Name** to `switch.adl`, to make it nice and easy to see which
    network I am on if I do an `ipconfig`/`ifconfig` from a connected device.

    ![](/posts/5/image-10.png)

    ![](/posts/5/image-11.png)

    Then scroll down to the bottom and click `Save`.
    <br></br>

8. Navigate to **Firewall / Rules**, and select the interface name you just created (`ADLSWITCH` for me). Click on `Add` to create a temporary "allow all" rule to test the configuration works.

    ![](/posts/5/image-12.png)

    Use the following settings:

    ![](/posts/5/image-13.png)

    ***üî• Don't forget to harden your firewall later, based on your use case and security purposes! üî•***
    <br></br>

9. Go to **Services / DNS Resolver** and check that **Network Interfaces has ‚ÄúAll‚Äù selected.** This is <mark class="simple-highlight">very important</mark> - and will ensure the DNS Resolver will know to look for and operate on your new network interface.

    ![](/posts/5/image-14.png)

    Scroll down and press `Save`, *THEN* scroll back up and press `Apply Changes` at the top of the page.

    <br></br>

10. From here, you should now have a functioning VLAN setup, managed by pfSense. Give yourself a pat on the back and have a cookie, you've earned it ~ üç™!

***Now, referring back to my network diagram, I want to also setup a UniFi USW switch to assign VLANs to devices based on the port they're plugged into.***

## - Assigning VLANs based on port in UniFi:

1. Connect a **factory-reset USW switch** to the end of the ethernet cable plugged into `ETH3`, and the switch SHOULD receive an IP on the IP range you specified for `VLAN 80` above (for me, `192.168.80.X/24`), if you've followed the above steps correctly *(and you sacrificed at least two goats to the networking gods earlier that day)*
<br></br>

2. From there you can follow the normal process of adopting the switch to a UniFi controller like here, but my use case was a little more compex.

    If you want to adopt the switch to a **remote UniFi controller** like I did (i.e. one that is hosted on **another
    LAN/remote network**, for example `172.16.66.X/24`), **connect a laptop to the USW switch**, make sure it receives an IP
    **on the same network as the switch** (in my case, the one using `VLAN 80` - `192.168.80.X/24`), and then ssh into the
    switch with default creds `ubnt/ubnt`

    e.g `ssh ubnt@[ip-of-switch]` & then enter `ubnt` when prompted for the password.
<br></br>

3. Issue the command: `set-inform http://ip-of-host:8080/inform` to direct the switch to the IP of your unifi cloud controller. (e.g. the command I ran was `set-inform http://172.16.66.35:8080/inform`)

    ***Make sure this address is reachable from VLAN 80‚Äôs network by adjusting pfSense firewall rules !!***
<br></br>

4. On your unifi controller, go to **System / Networks**.

    Create a `VLAN-only` UniFi ‚ÄòNetwork‚Äô, specifying **the same VLAN ID as set in pfSense** (in my case, `80` - these MUST
    MATCH between UniFi & pfSense!).

    ![](/posts/5/image-17.png)

    ![](/posts/5/image-18.png)
    <br></br>

5. Go to **System / Profiles**.

    Here, create a port profile with the **native network** being set as ***whatever VLAN-ONLY network you want all passing
    traffic tagged as.***
    E.g. by setting the **native network** to the UniFi network we just created will **add the `VLAN 80` to passing
    traffic**, **BEFORE it reaches the pfSense.**

    ![](/posts/5/image-19.png)

    ![](/posts/5/image-20.png)
    <br></br>


6. Recall from Step 3 that we configured ETH3 to **add a VLAN tag of `80`** (matching its `Port VID`) to **all UNTAGGED traffic** passing through it by default.

    Thus, to allow a device hooked up to the switch to be assigned & routed to a **different VLAN** (VLAN 75, per say) you
    MUST remember to go to **Interfaces / Switches / VLANs** and **ADD whatever pfsense port the switch is connected to**
    (ETH3 in our case) to the ‚Äòmembers‚Äô section of the **corresponding VLAN** (e.g. `VLAN 75`)

    If the traffic is arriving pre-tagged by the switch, make sure to add the member as **tagged**.

    See below: now BOTH ports `ETH3` & `ETH7` are configured to let through traffic tagged with **VLAN 75**.

    ![](/posts/5/image-4.png)
    <br></br>


## - And now... you're done!
***Now you should be able to use a UniFi switch to tag traffic coming through particular ports with specified VLAN tags, & have it routed to the corresponding VLAN network on the pfsense!***
